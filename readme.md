# <Team Profile Gen>

## Description


Using the VSC terminal, the user will input the information of their role in their company. The code will display the team created through the index and export it for all to see. 

- Motivation for this project was to be able to create a team that would display their email, office number, and ID number in the most efficient manner
- I built this project so that I could get a better understanding of test files, and how they can be used to psuedo code the real javascript files.
- It solves the problem of generating a display to show an entire teams basic information with quick info about them
- Connecting roles between each other makes more less complicated code. We could have done one long code in one javascript file, but breaking it down into multiple makes it manageable.
